Welcome !!
===========

to SimLogique project
--------

SimLogique is a logic circuit editor and simulator I'm building, for fun and educational purpose (to explain how computer works)

I already build a JavaScript prototype of it, but I'm now moving to C++ for performance and code maintainability.

Test the JS version here: http://wwwetu.utc.fr/~hebantma/simlogique/
